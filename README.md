## About

Bamazon retreives a set of mock storefront data from mySQL then returns it into a table that yuo can then buy from.

The table will show and then you will be prompted with questions to determine what you would like to buy from the store front.

From There you will select an item id and a quantity of how many of that item you would like to purchase.
Once you have selected the store front will update then you will be given your order summary and asked if you would like to puwrchase again.

If you would like to buy again it reruns you through the previous prompt but with updated items in the DB.

If you wouldn't like to buy again you then would be exited out of the application.
